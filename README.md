# Lithuanian Keyboard
Inspired by Google Keyboard.  
This keyboard is modified from another open source keyboard. The look is completely renwed with google's material design, changed the look and feel of keys and buttons. I tried to copy Google keyboard minus unneeded functionality and simpler interaction. I learned to read and understand other people's code, look for information about androids API, how it works (e.g. OnDraw method was the main thing modified in this app, as well as how the CapsLock works). I am really happy about how it turned out, it feels really nice to use and my friends like it too. I am looking forward to extending the fucntionality, like adding a dark mode, option to make the keyboard smaller, add emojis, perhaps even add auto correct and prediction (which was in the original code, however it was English and I don't have any idea how it imagine it to be a pretty big task).
